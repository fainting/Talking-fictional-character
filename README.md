# NovelChat: A Character-Aware Chatbot Trained on Novels

## Summary

**NovelChat** is an AI-powered chatbot that mimics the unique speech patterns of fictional characters from novels. By analyzing character-specific dialogue from a book, it creates an immersive chat experience where users can interact with their favorite literary personas. This project enhances reader engagement, supports educational applications, and explores the intersection of natural language processing and creative storytelling.

## üìå Your Idea in a Nutshell

**NovelChat** is an AI chatbot that reads through a novel and learns how a specific character speaks. It can then carry on a conversation using that character‚Äôs unique language style, making it feel like you're chatting with someone straight out of a book.

## üìñ Background

### What Problem Does It Solve?
Readers often develop strong emotional connections to fictional characters and wish they could interact with them beyond the boundaries of the book. However, books are static and don't allow for dynamic interaction.

### How Common Is This Problem?
This is especially common among fans of popular or classic literature who feel a "book hangover" after finishing a story. Fan communities often express the desire to continue engaging with characters.

### Why Is It Important or Interesting?
This project adds an interactive layer to literary experiences, making reading more immersive. It also offers educational benefits, allowing students and writers to better understand character development and stylistic choices.

### Personal Motivation
As a literature enthusiast, I‚Äôve always wanted to ‚Äútalk‚Äù to fictional characters after finishing a great book. NovelChat brings that dream closer to reality.

## üß† Data and AI Techniques

### Data Sources
- Public domain novels from sources like [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/)
- Extracted character dialogues from full texts
- (Optional) User-uploaded custom novels for private use

### AI Techniques
- Named Entity Recognition (NER) to identify and isolate character-specific dialogues
- Text embedding (e.g., BERT or SentenceTransformers) to analyze stylistic patterns
- Fine-tuning language models (e.g., GPT-3/4, LLaMA, Mistral) on character-specific corpora
- Persona modeling to maintain consistency across conversations

Optional implementation may involve using tools like:
- Hugging Face Transformers
- LangChain or RAG for retrieval-augmented conversations

## üßë‚Äçüí¨ How Is It Used?

### Users
- General readers and fans
- Writers exploring character dialogue
- Teachers and students in literature classes

### Usage Scenario
1. User selects a book and a character from the interface.
2. The chatbot begins responding in the voice of that character.
3. Optional: multi-character group chats, or AI-enhanced ‚Äústory extensions.‚Äù

## üöß Challenges

- **Style accuracy:** Harder for minor characters due to limited data.
- **Consistency:** Difficult to maintain long-term context or emotional continuity.
- **Copyright issues:** Limited to public domain or licensed content unless user provides text.
- **Complexity of language:** Sarcasm, metaphor, and cultural context are hard to model.
- **Overfitting:** Risk of making characters sound too exaggerated or robotic.

## üå± What Next?

- Support for multi-character dialogues and group chat simulations
- User-uploaded books for creating custom AI personas
- Integration into educational platforms for literature engagement
- Multilingual support: Talk to Shakespeare in Mandarin or Dostoevsky in French
